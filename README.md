<h1>The Amethyst Project</h1>
<p>
  This website is a scoreboard of the best, silly (random) messages sent each day. The messages are sent by two people and uploaded to a firebase database.
  
  This is a random little project made with love by both myself and a friend. 
  
  The initial objective of this project was to help teach a friend by building a website.
